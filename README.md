# AnyCloudBLE Scanner

This project is a command line interface to the world of Bluetooth Low Energy.  It starts up and "observes" all BLE packets.  It then stores the data in a table for later examination.

It has been tested to work on the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012.  But it should work on any Cypress PSoC 6/CYW43xxx development boards.
